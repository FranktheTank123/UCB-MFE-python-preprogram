Dear corrector,

You will be able to navigate through different routes:
- the Hello world welcome page
- the health check page
- the my_name_is page
- the data page, which allows us to see all the data in the database
- the pipelines page, which displays the average of the validated scores by cross-checking for different models. It takes approximately 3 mins to process.
- the timestamp page, which displays the predicted value for a given timestamp, and the chosen model with its best parameters.
