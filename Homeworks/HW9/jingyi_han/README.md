UCB Pre Program Python Course - Animal Face Recognition App

The animal face recognition model was trained using 3208 animal face images shown in the following 8 categories. The model was designed as a classification model to distinguish an input face image between the 8 categories. For details regarding model training, please refer to `model_training.ipynb`.

An interface was then implemented to take user input and attends to identify which catergory the face falls under. An example is shown below.

The result would identify the face as the category with highest probability and show an pie chart of the distribution of the probability for each category as shown in the example below.
